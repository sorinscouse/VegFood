## VegFood

* This project has been developed from complete scratch, using the latest web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of jQuery.

* The website is fully responsive. Responsive web design is a must have skill in today's mobile world, which means that [VegFood](https://sorinscouse.github.io/VegFood/) looks beautifully on all screen sizes.

* I used jQuery for some cool effects, like animations, scroll effects, and sticky navigation.
