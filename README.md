## VegFood

* This project has been developed from complete scratch, using the latest web technologies: **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and a little bit of **jQuery**.

* * [VegFood](https://sorinscouse.github.io/VegFood/) it's a website, for a vegan restaurant that sells plant based food.

* The website is fully responsive. Responsive web design is a must have skill in today's mobile world, which means that [VegFood](https://sorinscouse.github.io/VegFood/) looks beautifully on all screen sizes!

* I used **jQuery** for some cool effects, like animations, scroll effects, and sticky navigation.
